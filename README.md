# Advertisement Success Predictor :bar_chart:

## Overview
The **Advertisement Success Predictor** leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of success for online advertisements on Avito, Russia's largest classified advertisement website. This tool aims to assist sellers by predicting deal probabilities based on advertisement content and historical data, helping optimize their listings for better performance.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis:** Predicts the deal probability for listings using advanced machine learning algorithms.
- **Data Insights:** Provides insights into factors influencing advertisement success through extensive exploratory data analysis.
- **Custom Model Training:** Includes functionality for users to train the model with their own data, enhancing predictive accuracy.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Utilizes Matplotlib and Seaborn for dynamic data visualization, aiding in better understanding and decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For general programming.
- **Scikit-Learn, XGBoost:** For building and tuning machine learning models.
- **Pandas, NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly:** For creating interactive and static visualizations.

## Challenges & Improvements
### Challenges
- **Handling Missing Data:** Significant effort is required to handle missing values and anomalies within large datasets.
- **Model Overfitting:** Ensuring the model generalizes well to new data, avoiding overfitting to the training set.
- **Scalability:** Managing the computational demand as data volume increases.

### Proposed Improvements
- **Enhanced Data Preprocessing:** Implementing more sophisticated methods for data imputation and anomaly detection.
- **Advanced Model Tuning:** Utilizing techniques like grid search and randomized search to find optimal model parameters.
- **Deployment Scalability:** Optimizing the model to handle larger datasets efficiently without performance degradation.

## How to Use
1. **Prepare your environment:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Run the analysis notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
    ```
3. **Train the model with custom data:**
    ```python
    python train.py --data your_data.csv
    ```
